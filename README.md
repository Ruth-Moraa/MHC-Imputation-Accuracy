# MHC-Imputation-Accuracy

## Hello world!!
### So excited to have you here.

## Introduction
Genome wide association studies (GWAS) traditionally use genotyping arrays to genotype large sets of individuals, usually cases and controls, to determine which SNPs are significantly overrepresented in the cases to identify associations with disease. Genotyping arrays are cheaper than sequencing but only “measure” tag or selected SNPs across the genome (up to2.5 million SNPs). To increase the number of available SNPs per individual one can then use a reference panel of whole genome sequence data from related populations to impute SNPs from the ones on the array. This can be done due to the non-random inheritance of SNPs, or linkage disequilibrium (LD).Several methods are available for imputation, as are several different reference panels.

There are some regions on the human genome that have high variability and thus may be difficult to impute. This includes the major histocompatibility (MHC) region. This project will look at different arrays, imputation tools and reference panels to evaluate the accuracy of imputation in MHC regions in different populations, including European and African. African populations have high diversity and thus are more difficult to work with.Once imputed the project can then characterise and compare MHC region SNPs across populations.

## Project description
Genotype imputation refers to the statistical inference of unobserved genotypes.

This project focusses on assessing the accuracy of imputation tools, reference panels, sample sizes and chip densities used for genotype imputation in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region.

### Project vision
The Major histocompatibility Complex (MHC) region has been associated to autoimmune and immune mediated diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. Accurate imputation of this highly polymorphic region would increase the chances of identifying the causal variants of some autoimmune and immune mediated diseases.
